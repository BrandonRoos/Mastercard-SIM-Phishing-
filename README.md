# Mastercard-SIM-Phishing-
*Identify and Prevent Security Risks with our Security Awareness Team*

## Design a Phishing Email Simulation

### Objective
Craft a phishing email simulation to raise awareness about one of the most common threats organizations face today.

### Learning Outcomes
- Understand the threat phishing presents to an organization.
- Recognize different types of phishing emails.
- Learn how Mastercard prevents and mitigates phishing threats.

### Activities
Examine an obvious fake email and make it more believable.

### Context
As an analyst in Mastercard's Security Awareness Team, our Chief Security Officer (CSO) relies on us to help staff identify and report security threats. Phishing is a significant threat, involving attackers pretending to be someone else to obtain sensitive information. Successful phishing attempts can cost companies like Mastercard millions of dollars and put employees at risk.

At Mastercard, we mitigate phishing threats by educating our staff about the risks and how to identify them through phishing simulation campaigns:
- We test our staff monthly by sending fake phishing emails designed to resemble those from bad actors.
- We use the simulation results to design and implement future training.

## Interpret Phishing Simulation Results

### Objective
Interpret the performance of the phishing email simulation to deliver phishing prevention training to the affected teams.

### Learning Outcomes
- Identify areas of the business needing more awareness about phishing.
- Design and implement appropriate training for those teams to lower our risk of an attack.
### Activities
Create a short presentation to help teams improve security awareness.

### Context
The phishing simulation designed in Task One was run last week. We analyzed the results to identify which teams need more awareness and training about phishing.

### Results Analysis
